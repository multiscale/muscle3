Welcome to MUSCLE3's documentation!
===================================

MUSCLE3 is the third incarnation of the Multiscale Coupling Library and
Environment.

With MUSCLE3, you can connect multiple simulation models together into a
multiscale simulation. Simulation models can be as simple as a single Python
file, or as complex as a combination of multiple separate simulation codes
written in C++ or Fortran, and running on an HPC machine.

If you use MUSCLE3 for scientific work, please `cite
the version of the MUSCLE3 software you used
<https://www.research-software.nl/software/muscle3>`_ and the following paper:
