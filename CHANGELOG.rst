All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.

0.7.0
*****

Added
-----

* Checkpointing is now supported in C++ and Fortran as well
* Added built-in profiling feature
* New object-oriented Fortran API (existing API also still available)
* New Instance.list_settings() function
* Build support for macOS with CLang and G++/GFortran
* Build support for Cray machines and compilers

Improved
--------

* Compiling with MPI and linking without or vice versa is now impossible
* Fixed MessagePack build failure on old OSes
* Fixed resource allocation for instance sets
* Planner now detects F_INIT -> O_F loops and gives an error
* Manager correctly handles instances that never register
* Last lines of log now printer to screen on error for smoother problem solving
* Various small fixes and improvements


Backwards Incompatible changes
------------------------------

* `Instance.reuse_instance` no longer accepts `apply_overlay` argument. Use
  `InstanceFlags.DONT_APPLY_OVERLAY` when creating the instance instead.
* `LIBMUSCLE_Instance_create` signature has changed, this might lead to errors like:

  .. code-block:: text

       30 |     instance = LIBMUSCLE_Instance_create(ports, MPI_COMM_WORLD, root_rank)
          |               1
    Error: Type mismatch in argument ‘flags’ at (1); passed INTEGER(4) to TYPE(libmuscle_instanceflags)

  You may provide an explicit `InstanceFlags()` argument, or use named arguments:

  .. code-block:: fortran

    instance = LIBMUSCLE_Instance_create(ports, LIBMUSCLE_InstanceFlags(), MPI_COMM_WORLD, root_rank)
    instance = LIBMUSCLE_Instance_create(ports, communicator=MPI_COMM_WORLD, root=root_rank)

* ``DataConstRef`` items can no longer be added to a ``Data`` containing a list or dict.
  The newly added ``DataConstRef::list`` and ``DataConstRef::dict`` should be used
  instead.

Thanks
------

* Maarten at Ignition Computing for implementing much of the above
* Peter for debugging the MessagePack build issue
* Peter, Jon and Gavin for ARCHER2 access and support
* Koen for testing macOS build support
* Everyone who reported issues and contributed feature ideas!


0.6.0
*****

Added
-----

* Automatic resource management for components on HPC

Improved
--------

* Build and installation process now even easier

Thanks
------

* Stefan, Merijn and Maarten for reporting issues

0.4.0
*****

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Python produces more detailed logs to aid in debugging
* Improved pkg-config set-up
* Improved build system output to help find problems
* Documentation on logging in Python

Fixed
-----

Thanks
------

-----

* Support for sending and receiving multidimensional grids/arrays
* Support for Python 3.8

Improved
--------

* Python 3.5.1 support
* Build compatibility on more operating systems

Thanks
------

0.3.0
*****

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Data::key() now returns std::string instead of DataConstRef.
* Data::value() now return Data rather than DataConstRef

Added
-----

* Support for Fortran, including MPI

Improved
--------

* Fixes to examples
* Small documentation improvements
* Improved compatibility with other packages using gRPC


Thanks
------

* Pavel for reporting documentation/examples issues
* Derek for testing on Eagle
* Dongwei for reporting the gRPC issue


0.2.0
*****

Added
-----

* Support for C++
* Support for MPI in C++

Improved
--------

* Cluster/HPC networking

Incompatible Changes
-------

* Fatal logic errors now throw instead of exiting, so that you have a chance
  to shut down the model cleanly before exiting.
* Instance.exit_error() was replaced by Instance.error_shutdown(), which no
  longer exits the process, it just shuts down the Instance.
* Central MUSCLE 3-managed settings are called settings everywhere now, not
  parameters. As a result, the API has changed in several places.

*****

Initial release of MUSCLE 3.

Added
-----
* Coupling different submodel instances
* Spatial and temporal scale separation and overlap
* Settings management
* Combining features
