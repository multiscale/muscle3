Installing
==========

As described before, MUSCLE3 consists of several components: libmuscle, the
YMMSL Python library, and the MUSCLE Manager. Furthermore, libmuscle currently
has a Python and a C++ version.

Python
------

Installing MUSCLE3 on Python will install all the Python-based components of
the system, i.e. the Python version of libmuscle, the YMMSL Python library, and
the MUSCLE Manager. This requires at least Python 3.7.

MUSCLE3 is on PyPI as an ordinary Python package, so it can be installed via
Pip in the usual way. It's normally a good idea to make a virtual environment
(virtualenv), if you don't yet have one:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~$ python3 -m venv muscle3_venv
  ~$ . muscle3_venv/bin/activate
  (muscle3_venv)~$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
  (muscle3_venv)~$ pip install muscle3


This will create a Python virtualenv in a directory named ``muscle3_venv`` in
your home directory, and then activate it. This means that when you run Python,
it will use the version of Python in the virtual environment, and see the
packages you have installed there. Of course, you can put it wherever you want
it.

Next, we upgrade ``pip``, the Python package installer (most systems have an old
version, and old versions sometimes give problems), ``setuptools`` (same thing)
and we install ``wheel`` (which can cause packages to fail to install if it's
not there).

Having made a good environment, we can then install MUSCLE3 inside of it. Once
that's done, you can use MUSCLE3 whenever you have the virtualenv activated.
This will also install the Python YMMSL library, and any required dependencies.

You can also install MUSCLE3 without a virtualenv if your system allows that.
The advantage of virtual environments is that you can keep different programs
separate, and reduce the chance of library version mismatches. On the other
hand, not having to activate the virtual environment saves you a step. If you
get any error messages, try upgrading pip, setuptools and wheel as shown above,
and then try again.

If you want to install the Python YMMSL library without installing MUSCLE3,
then you can use

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ pip3 install ymmsl


C++ and Fortran
---------------

To work with MUSCLE3 from C++ and/or Fortran, you need to install the native
version of libmuscle. Currently, that means building it from source. This is a
bit more involved than installing the Python version, but comparable to (and
maybe slightly easier than) installing most C++ or Fortran libraries.

Prerequisites
`````````````

Building libmuscle is currently supported on GNU/Linux and macOS. To build
libmuscle, we'll need:

- A C++14 compiler, like GCC, Clang, or the proprietary Intel® [#f1]_ compilers
- GNU make 3.82 or later
- CMake
- PkgConfig
- Curl or wget
- Some common UNIX utilities like ar and cp and sed

There are two more optional dependencies:

- A Fortran compiler, like GFortran or the Intel one (only for Fortran support)
- OpenMPI or Intel MPI (only for MPI support)

If you are compiling models then you probably already have most or all of the
required tools installed, and the libmuscle build system tries to support a
range of tools so that you can work with what's familiar.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      MUSCLE3 supports three different compilers on Linux: GCC, Clang, and
      Intel. You'll need at least one of those to build libmuscle.

      .. tabs::

         .. group-tab:: GCC

            On Debian (or Ubuntu) based desktop systems, ``sudo apt-get install
            g++`` will install the GNU C++ compiler. If you need Fortran too,
            use ``sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran`` instead to also get
            GFortran.

         .. group-tab:: Clang

            On Debian (or Ubuntu) based desktop systems, ``sudo apt-get install
            clang`` will install Clang. Since there is no Fortran front-end for
            clang yet, you'll have to combine it with GFortran using ``sudo
            apt-get install clang gfortran`` if you need or want both Clang and
            Fortran support. Note that you need a slightly modified build
            command to make this work, see below.

         .. group-tab:: Intel

            For Intel®, you will have to install the Intel® oneAPI according to
            the instructions on the Intel® website. If you're on Ubuntu and you
            chose to use the repository, then you need at least
            ``intel-oneapi-compiler-dpcpp-cpp``, and
            ``intel-oneapi-compiler-fortran`` for Fortran support.

            If you are using the Intel® compiler, then you'll probably want to
            use Intel® MPI as well, which you can get from the
            ``intel-oneapi-mpi-devel`` package.

      On a Debian (or Ubuntu) based desktop system, ``sudo apt-get install
      build-essential cmake pkg-config wget`` should install all the other
      necessities. If you need MPI support, then you can use ``sudo apt-get
      install libopenmpi-dev`` to install OpenMPI.

      On an HPC cluster, there are usually ``module load`` commands that will
      make the compiler, gmake and cmake available, as well as MPI if needed.
      The exact command will vary from machine to machine, so consult the
      documentation for your cluster and/or ask the helpdesk, or try ``module
      avail`` for a list of what's there. ``cmake`` is only needed to build the
      MessagePack dependency, so if that's already available then you don't need
      ``cmake``.

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. tabs::

         .. group-tab:: Clang

            The development tools for macOS are called XCode, and you've
            probably got them installed already. XCode includes Clang as its
            default compiler, and the MUSCLE3 build system will automatically
            use it.

            To get the other tools, we recommend using Homebrew to install them.
            Depending on the version of macOS and XCode you're running, you may
            have to add CMake and PkgConfig using

            .. code:: bash

               brew install cmake
               brew install pkg-config

            Note that XCode does not include a Fortran compiler. If you need
            Fortran on macOS, you should use GCC instead of Clang/XCode, see the
            other tab.


         .. group-tab:: GCC and GFortran

            If you need Fortran support on macOS, then you'll have to install
            the GNU compilers, as XCode doesn't have Fortran support. The
            easiest way to do this is using Homebrew:

            .. code:: bash

               brew install gcc

            The other tools can be installed using Homebrew as well. In
            particular, you may have to install CMake and PkgConfig using

            .. code:: bash

               brew install cmake
               brew install pkg-config


            Since XCode provides a ``gcc`` command that actually calls Clang,
            you'll need to explicitly tell MUSCLE3 to use g++ and gfortran, see
            the instructions below.


      .. warning::

         Do not use Homebrew to install MessagePack. The Homebrew
         installation seems to have a broken PkgConfig file, causing it to
         be misdetected by the MUSCLE3 build system. Instead, just let
         MUSCLE3 download and install it for you and all will be fine.


(No) dependencies
`````````````````

MUSCLE3 is mostly self-contained, but it does have twe dependencies, one of
which is required. If you have them available, then they should be detected
automatically. If not, MUSCLE3 will **download and install them
automatically**.

The dependencies are:

- MessagePack 3.2.0 or later
- GoogleTest 1.8.1 or later (only for building the tests)


If your model uses any of these dependencies directly, then it's best to install
that dependency on your system, either via the package manager or from source,
and then link both your library and MUSCLE3 to the dependency. (See below for
how to point the build to your installation.) This avoids having two different
versions around and active at the same time. Otherwise, it's easier to rely on
the automatic installation.

Downloading
```````````

With the tools available, we can download and install MUSCLE3. First, we create
a working directory, download MUSCLE3 into it, then unpack the downloaded
archive and enter the main directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~$ mkdir muscle3_source
  ~$ cd muscle3_source
  ~/muscle3_source$ wget https://github.com/multiscale/muscle3/archive/%%VERSION%%/muscle3-%%VERSION%%.tar.gz
  ~/muscle3_source$ tar xf muscle3-%%VERSION%%.tar.gz
  ~/muscle3_source$ cd muscle3-%%VERSION%%


Of course, you can put the source anywhere you like.

Building
````````
Building MUSCLE3 is done by running ``make`` in the source directory, but
depending on the platform, a few extra definitions may be needed to inform the
build system of how we want it to do the build.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. tabs::

         .. group-tab:: GCC

            Using GCC (and GFortran, if available) on Linux is the default, so
            to start the build you can use

            .. code-block:: bash

              ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ make

         .. group-tab:: Clang

            To build with clang, use

            .. code-block:: bash

              ~/mucle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ CXXFLAGS=-fPIE OMPI_CXX=clang++ CXX=clang++ make


            This will tell the build system to use clang for compiling the C++
            code and its MPI support, but still use GFortran to compile the
            Fortran code (if GFortran is installed). The extra ``-fPIE`` switch
            is needed to make that combination work on some common platforms.

            If you don't have MPI support installed then ``OMPI_CXX`` will not
            be used, but it won't get in the way either.

         .. group-tab:: Intel

            To build with the Intel® compiler, use

            .. code-block:: bash

              ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ CXX=icpx MPICXX='mpiicpc -cxx=icpx' FC=ifx MPIFC='mpiifort -fc=ifx' make


            This will tell the build system to use the Intel® C++ and Fortran
            compilers to compile MUSCLE3. Note that the Classic compilers
            (``icc`` and ``ifort``) seem to work for the library but not for the
            test suite. As they are obsolete, this will not be fixed.


   .. group-tab:: macOS

      .. tabs::

         .. group-tab:: Clang

            Using XCode's Clang is the default on macOS, so to start the build
            you can use

            .. code-block:: bash

               ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ make


            Note that XCode Clang and GFortran aren't compatible on macOS, so
            you cannot compile MUSCLE3 with that combination. If you have
            GFortran installed but you want to use only Clang to build MUSCLE3
            without Fortran support, then you should disable Fortran explicitly
            to keep the build system from selecting that invalid combination:

            .. code-block:: bash

               ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ FC= make


         .. group-tab:: GCC and GFortran

            To use GCC, you'll need to tell the build system to use it
            explicitly, since XCode aliases the ``g++`` command to its Clang
            installation, and MUSCLE3 will pick that up if you don't tell it
            otherwise.

            Homebrew installs the GCC compilers with a name like ``g++-12`` and
            ``gfortran-12``, which does not collide with XCode. The following
            command will tell MUSCLE3 to build using them:

            .. code-block:: bash

               ~/muscle3_source/muscle3_%%VERSION%%$ CXX=g++-12 OMPI_CXX=g++-12 FC=gfortran-12 OMPI_FC=gfortran-12 make


            If you have a different version, then you need to change the name
            accordingly. You can find which version you have installed using

            .. code-block:: bash

               $ brew info gcc


This will take a few minutes (including building the dependencies), depending on
the speed of your machine.

.. collapse:: Customising the build


   You can control the build process in more detail by setting environment
   variables, as follows:

   NCORES=<n>
       Use the given number of cores to compile MUSCLE3. By default, MUSCLE3
       will use as many cores (threads) as you have. If you want to use fewer,
       you can set the number here. Using more will not make it go faster, and
       is not recommended.

   CXX=<compiler command>
       By default, MUSCLE3 will try to compile itself using ``g++`` or
       ``clang++``. If you want to use a different compiler, then you can set
       CXX to something else.

   MPICXX=<compiler command>
       To compile MPI code, MUSCLE3 will try to prefix the CXX command with
       ``mpi``, and if that's not available try ``mpic++``. To override, set
       MPICXX to the desired command.

   FC=<compiler command>
       Sets the compiler command for Fortran files. MUSCLE3 will try
       ``gfortran``, ``f95`` and ``f77``. To use something else, set this
       variable.

   MPIFC=<compiler command>
       The command for compiling Fortran MPI code. MUSCLE3 will try to prefix FC
       with ``mpi``, then try ``mpifort`` and ``mpif90``. Setting MPIFC will
       override this choice.

   DOWNLOAD=<download command>
       MUSCLE3 will try to use either ``wget`` or ``curl -LO`` to download
       dependencies. This lets you override the command to use, or select one
       explicitly. The command should accept a URL as the first argument, and
       download the file to the working directory, saving it under its original
       name.

   TAR=<tar command>
       This overrides the command used to unpack dependencies, which by default
       is ``tar``.

   msgpack_ROOT=<directory>
       Also look in the given directory when detecting the MsgPack library.

   googletest_ROOT=<directory>
       Also look in the given directory when detecting the GoogleTest library.

   As an example, to build libmuscle using 2 cores, you would do:

   .. code-block:: bash

     ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ NCORES=2 make


|

Getting help
````````````

The plan is for this to always magically work, but operating systems being as
diverse as they are (especially on HPC machines), it's possible that the build
will fail. In that case, have a look at the output to see if you can identify
an error message, and then go to
`the MUSCLE3 issues on GitHub <https://github.com/multiscale/muscle3/issues>`_
to see if the problem has been reported already, and if there's a work-around.

If not, please make a new issue with a description of the problem (preferably
mention the error in the issue title, so that others can find it), and attach a
log of the build. You can make a build log using:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ make distclean
  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ make >make.log 2>&1


This will produce a file named ``make.log`` with the build output in it. To
attach it to a GitHub issue, drag it into the text box from your file manager.

Installing
``````````

Once MUSCLE3 has been compiled, we need to install it. We recommend installing
it into a subdirectory of your home directory for now, as opposed to
``/usr/local/bin`` or something similar (although ``/opt/muscle3`` would be
okay), since there is no uninstall command yet that will cleanly remove it. That
goes like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ PREFIX=~/muscle3 make install


This command will install the native version of MUSCLE3 into the directory
specified by ``PREFIX``, in this case the ``muscle3`` directory in your home
directory.

From this point on, the source directory is no longer needed. If you don't want
to play with the examples (in ``docs/source/examples/cpp``) then you can remove
it if you want.

Building models with libmuscle
------------------------------

Once libmuscle is installed, you will have to add some code to your model to
talk to libmuscle, or you can write a model component from scratch. Examples of
how to do that are in the C++ and Fortran sections of this manual. In order to
compile and link your code with libmuscle, you have to adjust the compilation
and linking commands a bit though.

When compiling and linking, the compiler needs to be able to find the libmuscle
headers and libraries. This is done in three steps:

1. Make libmuscle available in the environment
2. Tell the compiler which headers to include
3. Tell the linker which libraries to link against

Making libmuscle available
``````````````````````````

The MUSCLE3 installation comes with a file that you can source into your shell,
which will set some environment variables needed to compile, link and run with
libmuscle. Activate it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ . <PREFIX>/bin/muscle3.env


Compiling with libmuscle
````````````````````````

To use your models with MUSCLE3, they need to use libmuscle, and to make that
possible we need to tell the compiler where to find it, both during compiling
and during linking. This can be done using PkgConfig, or directly by hand.

.. attention::

   C++ compilers are not guaranteed to produce code that can be linked together.
   In particular, newer versions of Clang use a different standard library than
   GCC and Intel at least on some platforms, which may cause compatibility
   problems. For Fortran, the .mod files created by the compiler are in a
   compiler-specific format, and cannot be used by other compilers.

   For best results, compile you model with the same compiler that you compiled
   MUSCLE3 with.

   Models compiled with different compilers work together just fine in a single
   simulation, so if you have one model that requires GCC and another that
   requires using the Intel compiler, the best thing to do is to make two
   separate installations of libmuscle, one with each compiler, and then use the
   corresponding one for each model. Do make sure you use the same version of
   MUSCLE3 for both, or they won't understand each other.

              -L${MUSCLE3_HOME}/lib -lymmsl -lmuscle


            to the command line.

         .. group-tab:: C++ with MPI

            When linking, the linker needs to be told where to find the
            ``ymmsl`` and ``libmuscle_mpi`` libraries, and that it should link
            with them. That's done by adding

            .. code-block::

              -L${MUSCLE3_HOME}/lib -lymmsl -lmuscle_mpi


            to the command line.

         .. group-tab:: Fortran

            When linking, the linker needs to be told where to find the
            required libraries, and that it should link with them. That's done
            by adding

            .. code-block::

              -L${MUSCLE3_HOME}/lib -lymmsl_fortran -lmuscle_fortran -lymmsl -lmuscle


            to the command line.

         .. group-tab:: Fortran with MPI

            When linking, the linker needs to be told where to find the
            required libraries, and that it should link with them. That's done
            by adding

            .. code-block::

              -L${MUSCLE3_HOME}/lib -lymmsl_fortran -lmuscle_mpi_fortran -lymmsl -lmuscle_mpi

            to the command line.


   .. note::

      You're most likely linking dynamically, but ``libmuscle`` does install
      static libraries in case you need them. If you link statically, then you
      must add the ``-pthread`` option, as ``libmuscle`` uses background threads
      for communication.


Running models
--------------

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      There's one more thing: the directory that you've installed MUSCLE into is
      probably not in your system's library search path, and as a result the dynamic
      linker won't be able to find the libraries when you run your program. In order
      to fix this, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` must be set, which you can do either by
      sourcing the ``muscle3.env`` file as described above, or with the following
      command:

      .. code-block:: bash

             ~$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PREFIX>/lib


      If you have just installed MUSCLE3, then the above bits are currently on your
      screen, so you can just copy-paste them from there.

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      On macOS, the compiler will automatically add a reference to the location
      of the libmuscle library into your executable. As a result, the OS will be
      able to find it when the model is started, so you do not have to do
      anything else.

      If you move libmuscle after installing it, you will break this mechanism,
      so please don't do that (or add the new location to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).
