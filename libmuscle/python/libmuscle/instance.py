        In a multiscale simulation, instances get reused all the time.
        For example, in a macro-micro simulation, the micromodel does a
        complete run for every timestep of the macromodel. Rather than
        starting up a new instance of the micromodel, which could be
        expensive, we reuse a single instance many times.

        This may bring other advantages, such as faster convergence
        when starting from the previous final state, and in some
        cases may be necessary if micromodel state needs to be
        preserved from one macro timestep to the next.

        So in MUSCLE, submodels run in a *reuse loop*, which runs them
        over and over again until their work is done and they should be
        shut down. Whether to do another F_INIT, O_I, S, O_F cycle
        is decided by this method.
