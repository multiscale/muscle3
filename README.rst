MUSCLE 3
========

MUSCLE 3 is the third incarnation of the MUSCLE Multiscale Coupling Library and
Environment. It is developed by the `ComPat`_ EU FP 7 project, and the e-MUSC
project of the University of Amsterdam and the Netherlands eScience Center.

MUSCLE 3 is currently in the early stages of design and development, so it's not
usable yet.
