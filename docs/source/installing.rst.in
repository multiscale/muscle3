Installing
==========

As described before, MUSCLE3 consists of several components: libmuscle, the
YMMSL Python library, and the MUSCLE Manager. Furthermore, libmuscle currently
has a Python and a C++ version.

Python
------

Installing MUSCLE3 on Python will install all the Python-based components of
the system, i.e. the Python version of libmuscle, the YMMSL Python library, and
the MUSCLE Manager. This requires at least Python 3.7.

MUSCLE3 is on PyPI as an ordinary Python package, so it can be installed via
Pip in the usual way. It's normally a good idea to make a virtual environment
(virtualenv), if you don't yet have one:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~$ python3 -m venv muscle3_venv
  ~$ . muscle3_venv/bin/activate
  (muscle3_venv)~$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
  (muscle3_venv)~$ pip install muscle3


This will create a Python virtualenv in a directory named ``muscle3_venv`` in
your home directory, and then activate it. This means that when you run Python,
it will use the version of Python in the virtual environment, and see the
packages you have installed there. Of course, you can put it wherever you want
it.

Next, we upgrade ``pip``, the Python package installer (most systems have an old
version, and old versions sometimes give problems), ``setuptools`` (same thing)
and we install ``wheel`` (which can cause packages to fail to install if it's
not there).

Having made a good environment, we can then install MUSCLE3 inside of it. Once
that's done, you can use MUSCLE3 whenever you have the virtualenv activated.
This will also install the Python YMMSL library, and any required dependencies.

You can also install MUSCLE3 without a virtualenv if your system allows that.
The advantage of virtual environments is that you can keep different programs
separate, and reduce the chance of library version mismatches. On the other
hand, not having to activate the virtual environment saves you a step. If you
get any error messages, try upgrading pip, setuptools and wheel as shown above,
and then try again.

If you want to install the Python YMMSL library without installing MUSCLE3,
then you can use

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ pip3 install ymmsl


C++
---

To work with MUSCLE3 from C++, you need to install the C++ version of
libmuscle. Currently, that means building it from source. This is a bit more
involved than installing the Python version, but comparable to (and maybe
slightly easier than) installing most C++ libraries.

Prerequisites
`````````````

To build libmuscle, we're going to need some tools. In particular, we need a C++
compiler and GNU make. MUSCLE3 uses C++14, so you need at least g++ 4.9.3.
Clang is also supported, as are the proprietary Intel® [#f1]_ compilers; see the
instructions below for how to use them. Other compilers have not been tested.
If you want to try, go right ahead, we'd love to have feedback on this. Building
has been tested with gmake 3.82 and 4.1.

If you're doing C++ development on a reasonably modern Linux, then you probably
already have a suitable compiler installed. If not, on a Debian (or Ubuntu)
based system, ``sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake gfortran pkg-config
wget`` should get you set up. On a cluster, there is usually a ``module load
g++`` or similar command available that sets you up with g++ and associated
tools, and similar for a Fortran compiler. The exact command will vary from
machine to machine, so consult the documentation for your cluster and/or ask the
helpdesk. ``cmake`` is only needed to build the MessagePack dependency, so if
that's already available then you don't need ``cmake```. On a cluster, there is
usually a ``cmake`` module to load.

MUSCLE3 can be built with **clang** as well, if you prefer. You'll need to
install it using something like ``sudo apt-get install clang``, and modify the
build command a bit, see below. Note that clang does not have a production-ready
Fortran compiler yet, but the commands below will help you build the C++ part
with clang, and the Fortran part with gfortran.

For Intel®, you will have to install the Intel® oneAPI according to the
instructions on the Intel® website. If you're on Ubuntu and you chose to use the
repository, then you need at least ``intel-oneapi-compiler-dpcpp-cpp``
and ``intel-oneapi-compiler-fortran``.

If your submodels use MPI, then you'll need to compile the MPI support for
MUSCLE3. This requires an MPI library to be available. Libmuscle has been
tested with OpenMPI on Ubuntu, but should work with other MPI implementations
(this being the point of the MPI standard). On Debian/Ubuntu, ``sudo apt-get
install libopenmpi-dev`` will install the OpenMPI development files needed to
compile libmuscle C++ with MPI support. On a cluster, there is probably a
``module load openmpi`` or similar command to make MPI available. If you are
using the Intel® compiler, then you'll probably want to use Intel® MPI as well,
which you can get from the ``intel-oneapi-mpi-devel`` package. MUSCLE3 only
uses very basic MPI functionality, so any version should do. MUSCLE3 will
automatically detect the availability of MPI, and build the MPI version of the
library if MPI is available.

(No) Dependencies
`````````````````

MUSCLE3 is mostly self-contained, but it does have twe dependencies, one of
which is required. If you have them available, then they should be detected
automatically. If not, MUSCLE3 will **download and install them
automatically**.

The dependencies are:

- MessagePack 3.2.0 or later
- GoogleTest 1.8.1 or later (only for building the tests)


If your model uses any of these dependencies directly, then it's best to install
that dependency on your system, either via the package manager or from source,
and then link both your library and MUSCLE3 to the dependency. (See below for
how to point the build to your installation.) This avoids having two different
versions around and active at the same time. Otherwise, it's easier to rely on
the automatic installation.

Downloading MUSCLE3
```````````````````

With the tools available, we can download and install MUSCLE3. First, we create
a working directory, download MUSCLE3 into it, then unpack the downloaded
archive and enter the main directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~$ mkdir muscle3_source
  ~$ cd muscle3_source
  ~/muscle3_source$ wget https://github.com/multiscale/muscle3/archive/%%VERSION%%/muscle3-%%VERSION%%.tar.gz
  ~/muscle3_source$ tar xf muscle3-%%VERSION%%.tar.gz
  ~/muscle3_source$ cd muscle3-%%VERSION%%


Of course, you can put the source anywhere you like.


Building MUSCLE3
````````````````

The basic command for building MUSCLE3 is:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ make


There are a few options that can be added by setting them as environment
variables. These are as follows:

NCORES=<n>
    Use the given number of cores to compile MUSCLE3. By default, MUSCLE3 will
    use as many cores (threads) as you have. If you want to use fewer, you can
    set the number here. Using more will not make it go faster, and is not
    recommended.

CXX=<compiler command>
    By default, MUSCLE3 will try to compile itself using ``g++`` or
    ``clang++``. If you want to use a different compiler, then you can set CXX
    to something else.

MPICXX=<compiler command>
    To compile MPI code, MUSCLE3 will try to prefix the CXX command with
    ``mpi``, and if that's not available try ``mpic++``. To override, set MPICXX
    to the desired command.

FC=<compiler command>
    Sets the compiler command for Fortran files. MUSCLE3 will try ``gfortran``,
    ``f95`` and ``f77``. To use something else, set this variable.

MPIFC=<compiler command>
    The command for compiling Fortran MPI code. MUSCLE3 will try to prefix FC
    with ``mpi``, then try ``mpifort`` and ``mpif90``. Setting MPIFC will
    override this choice.


DOWNLOAD=<download command>
    MUSCLE3 will try to use either ``wget`` or ``curl -LO`` to download
    dependencies. This lets you override the command to use, or select one
    explicitly. The command should accept a URL as the first argument, and
    download the file to the working directory, saving it under its original
    name.

TAR=<tar command>
    This overrides the command used to unpack dependencies, which by default is
    ``tar``.

msgpack_ROOT=<directory>
    Also look in the given directory when detecting the MsgPack library.

googletest_ROOT=<directory>
    Also look in the given directory when detecting the GoogleTest library.

As an example, to build libmuscle using 2 cores, you would do:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ NCORES=2 make


This will take a few minutes (including building the dependencies), depending on
the speed of your machine.

**Building with clang**

To build with clang, use

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/mucle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ CXXFLAGS=-fPIE OMPI_CXX=clang++ CXX=clang++ make


This will tell the build system to use clang for compiling the C++ code and its
MPI support, but still use gfortran to compile the Fortran code (if gfortran is
installed). The extra ``-fPIE`` switch is needed to make that combination work
on some common platforms.

**Building with Intel®**

To build with the Intel® compiler, use

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ CXX=icpx MPICXX='mpiicpc -cxx=icpx' FC=ifx MPIFC='mpiifort -fc=ifx' make


This will tell the build system to use the Intel® C++ and Fortran compilers to
compile MUSCLE3. Note that the Classic compilers (``icc`` and ``ifort``) seem to
work for the library but not for the test suite. As they are obsolete, this will
not be fixed.


Getting help
````````````

The plan is for this to always magically work, but operating systems being as
diverse as they are (especially on HPC machines), it's possible that the build
will fail. In that case, have a look at the output to see if you can identify
an error message, and then go to
`the MUSCLE3 issues on GitHub <https://github.com/multiscale/muscle3/issues>`_
to see if the problem has been reported already, and if there's a work-around.

If not, please make a new issue with a description of the problem (preferably
mention the error in the issue title, so that others can find it), and attach a
log of the build. You can make a build log using:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ make distclean
  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ make >make.log 2>&1


This will produce a file named ``make.log`` with the build output in it. To
attach it to a GitHub issue, drag it into the text box from your file manager.


Installing libmuscle C++
````````````````````````

Once MUSCLE3 has been compiled, we need to install it. We recommend installing
it into a subdirectory of your home directory for now, as opposed to
``/usr/local/bin`` or something similar (although ``/opt/muscle3`` would be
okay), since there is no uninstall command yet that will cleanly remove it. That
goes like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/muscle3_source/muscle3-%%VERSION%%$ PREFIX=~/muscle3 make install


This command will install the C++ version of MUSCLE3 into the directory
specified by ``PREFIX``, in this case the ``muscle3`` directory in your home
directory.

From this point on, the source directory is no longer needed. If you don't want
to play with the examples (in ``docs/source/examples/cpp``) then you can remove
it if you want.


Compiling and linking with libmuscle C++
````````````````````````````````````````

Once libmuscle is installed, you will have to add some code to your model to
talk to libmuscle, or you can write a model component from scratch. Examples of
how to do that are in the C++ section of this manual. In order to compile and
link your code with libmuscle, you have to adjust the compilation and linking
commands a bit though.

When compiling and linking, the compiler needs to be able to find the libmuscle
headers and libraries. This is done in three steps:

1. Make libmuscle available in the environment
2. Tell the compiler which headers to include
3. Tell the linker which libraries to link against

Making libmuscle available
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The MUSCLE3 installation comes with a file that you can source into your shell,
which will set some environment variables needed to compile, link and run with
libmuscle. Activate it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ . <PREFIX>/bin/muscle3.env


Compiling with libmuscle - Manually
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Next, when compiling, the compiler needs to be able to find the libmuscle
headers. This can be done either directly, or using PkgConfig. To directly point
to the headers, use

.. code-block::

  -I${MUSCLE3_HOME}/include


to your compiler command line. ``MUSCLE3_HOME`` is set by ``muscle3.env``, and
points to the directory where MUSCLE3 is installed. If your submodel uses MPI,
then you must add

.. code-block::

  -DMUSCLE_ENABLE_MPI


as well to make the MPI-specific parts of the libmuscle API available, and of
course remember to use ``mpic++`` or ``mpicxx`` to compile.

Compiling with libmuscle - PkgConfig
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You can also use PkgConfig with appropriate package names to obtain the right
compile options. For non-MPI code, use

.. code-block::

  pkg-config --cflags ymmsl libmuscle


to get the flags, or use your build system's PkgConfig support. For MPI code,
you should use

.. code-block::

  pkg-config --cflags ymmsl libmuscle_mpi


instead.

Linking with libmuscle - Manually
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When linking, the linker needs to be told where to find the ``ymmsl`` and
``libmuscle`` libraries, and that it should link with them. That's done by
adding

.. code-block::

  -L${MUSCLE3_HOME}/lib -lymmsl -lmuscle


to the command line, or for MPI implementations:

.. code-block::

  -L${MUSCLE3_HOME}/lib -lymmsl -lmuscle_mpi


You're most likely linking dynamically, but ``libmuscle`` does install static
libraries in case you need them. If you link statically, then you must add the
``-pthread`` option, as ``libmuscle`` uses background threads for communication.

Linking with libmuscle - PkgConfig
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To link a non-MPI component with libmuscle using PkgConfig, use

.. code-block::

  pkg-config --libs ymmsl libmuscle


to get the flogs, or use your build system's PkgConfig support with package
names ``ymmsl`` and ``libmuscle``. For MPI code, you should use

.. code-block::

  pkg-config --libs ymmsl libmuscle_mpi


instead.

Running with libmuscle
''''''''''''''''''''''

There's one more thing: the directory that you've installed MUSCLE into is
probably not in your system's library search path, and as a result the dynamic
linker won't be able to find the libraries when you run your program. In order
to fix this, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` must be set, which you can do either by
sourcing the ``muscle3.env`` file as described above, or with the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

       ~$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PREFIX>/lib


If you have just installed MUSCLE3, then the above bits are currently on your
screen, so you can just copy-paste them from there.

Intel® C++ compiler
```````````````````

You can compile MUSCLE3 with the Intel® compiler as described above, and then
use it for your model as well. It is also possible to compile MUSCLE3 with the
GNU compiler and your model with the Intel® compiler, and link them together.
(See below if your model is written in Fortran, you need to do it slightly
differently there.)


Fortran
-------

Once libmuscle is installed, you will have to add some code to your model to
talk to libmuscle, or you can write a component from scratch. Examples of how
to do that are in the Fortran section of this manual. In order to compile and
link your code with libmuscle, you have to adjust the compilation and linking
commands a bit though.

The Fortran bindings for libmuscle are a wrapper around the C++ implementation.
They will be built automatically if you follow the instructions above for
building and installing libmuscle C++, at least if you have a Fortran compiler
available. The instructions for Fortran are almost the same as for C++, but we
need a couple extra libraries.

Compiling and linking with libmuscle

When compiling and linking, the compiler needs to be able to find the libmuscle
headers and libraries. This is done in three steps:

to your compiler command line. ``MUSCLE3_HOME`` is set by ``muscle3.env``, and
points to the directory where MUSCLE3 is installed. In Fortran, there's a
separate module for MPI support, so there's no need for a ``-D`` option. You do
need to use ``mpifort`` or similar to compile.

Compiling with libmuscle - PkgConfig
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You can also use PkgConfig with appropriate package names to obtain the right
compile options. For non-MPI code, use

.. code-block::

  pkg-config --cflags ymmsl_fortran libmuscle_fortran


to get the flags, or use your build system's PkgConfig support. For MPI code,
you should use

.. code-block::

  pkg-config --cflags ymmsl_fortran libmuscle_mpi_fortran


instead.

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When linking, the linker needs to be told where to find the ``ymmsl`` and

to the command line, or for MPI implementations:

.. code-block::

If you have just installed MUSCLE3, then the above bits are currently on your
screen, so you can just copy-paste them from there.

Intel® Fortran compiler
```````````````````````

MUSCLE3 can be compiled with the Intel® compilers as described above, after
which you can compile your model with the Intel® Fortran compiler as well and
link with libmuscle.

Alternatively, you can compile MUSCLE3 with the GNU compilers, and then compile
your model with the Intel® compilers and link it to the GNU-compiled MUSCLE3
library, because the compilers are almost compatible. The one issue is that the
``.mod`` files created by the GNU compiler (and installed when you install
``libmuscle``) cannot be read by the Intel® compiler.

To solve this, you need to use the corresponding ``.f90`` files instead. These
are installed by in ``<PREFIX>/include``, and are called ``libmuscle.f90``,
``ymmsl.f90``, and ``libmuscle_mpi.f90``. You compile these as you would any
other source file in your submodel, and then link them with rest of the submodel
and the shared library as described above.
